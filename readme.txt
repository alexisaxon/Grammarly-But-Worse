Project Name: Grammarly But Worse

Project Description: The goal of my project is to develop a program that can suggest
and implement edits to a written document. When the user types into a textbox, the program 
will look for errors in spelling and suggest fixes, which are implemented at the click
of a button. The program also features the ability to bold, underline, italicize, copy,
paste and save text to the user's computer.

The program should be run from the frontend.py file. It requires cmu_112_graphics,
BeautifulSoup, PIL and Requests to run. The former two are included in the submission
folder and the latter two should be downloadable using the included module manager.

My project does not include any shortcut commands.
